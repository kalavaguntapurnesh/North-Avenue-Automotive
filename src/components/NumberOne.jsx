                  Using your own car gives you independence from external
                  circumstances and the opportunity to plan your day exactly how
                  you want. No rush to miss urban transport and even be late for
                  work, because of outside factors. With your own car, you feel

                  on the number of vehicles, on the road. Among them are
                  passenger cars, lorries, buses, etc. Bringing this into focus:
                  in 1986 there were only 500 million cars in the whole world.
                  And in 2010 the number increased to 1 billion vehicles.
                  Researchers with the International Energy Agency suggest that
                  by the year 2035 nearly 25 percent of the world population
                  will own a car. According to research, the current number is
                  going to increase to 1,7 billion. That's why auto car spare
